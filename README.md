### Preliminary Design

This is supposed to be a silly game, used to entertain casual gamers.

The players are pets dressed as sumo wrestlers. They are very round, and can barely touch the other player with their arms. The goal is to move the other pet out of the circle.

There are a few ways that this can be achieved:
- brute strength. This is the slowest way.
- Filling up the special meter, and performing a special move.
- Taking advantage of the player being stunned by the Crocodile Kings tricks.

There can be one or more rounds - this can be set by the player in the settings.

They can fight in a number of arenas - keep this modular so more arenas can be added later.

In addition to fighting each other, they are under the watch of the Crocodile King, and a large audience - this is in a style similar to Castle Crashers/Battleblock Theatre/The Oatmeal comic.
